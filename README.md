# imdb2emf: an IMDb parser creating EMF models

This little tool creates an EMF model from the IMDb files.

## Usage

Download the files actors.list.gz, actresses.list.gz, movies.list.gz, and
ratings.list.gz from [the IMDb download site](http://www.imdb.com/interfaces),
and put them in some directory.  You don't need to unzip them (but you may if
you want).

Download the `lein` script from
[the Leiningen homepage](http://www.leiningen.org) and put it into your `PATH`.

Then clone this project and run it:

````
$ git clone https://github.com/tsdh/imdb2emf.git
$ cd imdb2emf
$ lein run
Usage: lein run <imdb-dir>
       lein run <imdb-dir> <max-movie-count>
$ lein run path/to/imdb/ 1000
````

The last command will parse the first 1000 movies, all ratings of those movies,
and all actors and actresses that act at least in one of these movies.  (First,
the movies.list.gz file is parsed.  Thereafter, the actors.list.gz,
actresses.list.gz, and ratings.list.gz are parsed in parallel).

If you don't provide a maximum movie number, it'll parse the complete database.
That will be about one million movies, 1.5 million actors, 800k actresses, and
300k ratings.

The resulting XMI model files are named `imdb-<max-movie-count>.movies` if a
maximum movie number was provided and `imdb.movies` when the complete database
is parsed.

Additionally, the models are saved in a binary coding which is more space
efficient and much faster to load.  Those files have the ending `.movies.bin`.
